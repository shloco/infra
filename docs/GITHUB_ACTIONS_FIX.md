# GitHub Actions CDK Fix

## üêõ Problem

GitHub Actions was failing with the error:

```
sh: 1: cdk: not found
```

This happened because the CDK CLI was not available in the GitHub Actions environment.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflows**

- **Before**: Used `npm run cdk bootstrap` and `npm run deploy` which relied on globally installed CDK
- **After**: Uses `npx cdk bootstrap` and `npx cdk deploy` which uses the locally installed CDK

### 2. **Added CDK CLI as Dev Dependency**

Updated `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "aws-cdk": "^2.100.0"
    // ...other deps
  }
}
```

### 3. **Updated NPM Scripts**

Updated all CDK scripts to use `npx`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "cdk": "npx cdk",
    "deploy": "npx cdk deploy",
    "destroy": "npx cdk destroy",
    "diff": "npx cdk diff",
    "synth": "npx cdk synth",
    "bootstrap": "npx cdk bootstrap",
    "ls": "npx cdk ls"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Updated All Workflows**

- **deploy.yml**: Uses `npx cdk` for bootstrap and deploy
- **destroy.yml**: Uses `npx cdk destroy`
- **test workflow**: Uses `npx cdk synth`

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Consistent Environment**: Same CDK version used locally and in CI
2. **No Global Installation**: No need to install CDK globally in GitHub Actions
3. **Version Control**: CDK version is locked in package.json
4. **Faster CI**: No time spent installing global packages
5. **Reliability**: Uses the exact CDK version specified in dependencies

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Push the changes** to GitHub
2. **GitHub Actions will now work** without the "cdk: not found" error
3. **Test the deployment** by creating a pull request or pushing to main

## üìù Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated to use `npx cdk`
- `.github/workflows/destroy.yml` - Updated to use `npx cdk`
- `package.json` - Added CDK CLI as devDependency and updated scripts
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` - Updated documentation

The fix ensures that CDK commands work consistently across all environments! üéâ
